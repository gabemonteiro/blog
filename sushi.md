I have been eating sushi since I was a kid. However, rarely when I am in Portland do I venture beyond Takahashi. There are so many mediocre sushi spots that frankly, _don't compare_. Here's a few reasons why you should check them out if you haven't before.

1. *They only have dinner service:* Their focus is on quality rather than quantity. Serving the best food for only one meal.

2. *They have the freshest fish in town:* They shop at local fish markets _daily_ to bring the freshest quality to their dinner service.

3. *Large portions for every order:* Never have I experienced the dreaded quarter sized sushi roll at Takahashi. They always offer generous sizes to each of their rolls.

For these above reasons you should take the time to check them out.
